# Irrigation-System-Using-Arduino
Control an agricultural water pump automatically using an Arduino and relay module. This project allows farmers to switch the pump ON/OFF based on sensor input or scheduled timing, improving irrigation efficiency and reducing manual effort. This measures the soil moisture and on the bassis of that the pump got on and off.
